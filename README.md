# Contact Book

I have taken the solution to the assignment from the previous homework and add
storage phonebook contacts to `localStorage`. Used lifecycle methods.

When you add and delete a contact, the contacts are stored in the local storage.
When the application is loaded, contacts, if any, are read from local storage
and are written to the state.
